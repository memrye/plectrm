Plectrm is a (guitar) tablature editor, designed like a text editor. It is open source and written with Javascript. It is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.

## Why?  

ASCII tabs can either be written laboriously by hand in a text editor (where you have to physically backspace and type walls of characters while you score a song) or can be exported from scorewriting software (where you are required to know western music notation just for it to be translated into tablature anyway).  Plectrm aims to take the best parts of both and make it easy to format, write, and export ASCII tabs.
